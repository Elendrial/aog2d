Planning to be a 2d, turn based, resource control, strategy game. Based of Armies of Gielinor by Jagex, previously hosted at funorb.com before it's retirement. More information on the game can be found at http://funorb.wikia.com/wiki/Armies_of_Gielinor .

This is currently written entirely in java by myself, uses my RPGEngine as a base, and has ~0% of the 'core' done.


##TODO:

#### High priority:
- Basic unit movement systems
- Basic unit summoning systems
- Basic resource system
- Basic combat (melee/ranged)

#### Medium priority:
- Placeholder art
- Multiple map loading
- Complex unit movement systems (movement types/restrictions)
- Complex combat (attack advantage/disadvantage)


#### Low priority:
- Campaign
- Custom maps dynamically loaded (png?)
- Custom units/summon lists dynamically loaded (json?)
- Multiple tilesets

#### Very Low priority:
- Proper Art
- Multiplayer (will require semi-rewrite into server-client pairs)
- Custom ruleset dynamically loaded (json?)
